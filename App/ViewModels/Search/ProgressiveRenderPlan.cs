/// The rule is a duty cycle and nothing else: paint whenever anything new has arrived, unless the
/// previous paint was expensive enough that painting again this soon would take more than a small
/// share of the UI thread. Because the budget is a multiple of what the last paint ACTUALLY cost, it
/// needs no notion of how big the list is or how far into a search it is -- cheap paints run on every
/// tick, expensive ones space themselves out, and the thread stays free either way.
///
/// Earlier versions instead required the list to grow by a factor before repainting, on the assumption
/// that a paint necessarily costs what the whole list costs. That was true when every paint rebuilt
/// and re-reconciled everything, and it made the displayed count freeze for minutes near the end of a
/// long search -- the list could no longer double, so nothing painted at all. It stopped being true
/// once a paint could be told which rows actually changed (see StreamingResultAccumulator's
/// FirstChangedIndex), which makes a late-search paint cost a handful of rows rather than six hundred
/// thousand, and cheap enough that this rule lets it through on essentially every tick.
