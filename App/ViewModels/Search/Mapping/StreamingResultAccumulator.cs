/// <summary>
/// Builds the full window's rows incrementally as a search streams: each call maps and ranks only the
/// results that have arrived since the last one, then merges them into the order already established.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The mapper this replaces re-did everything on every paint -- rank-sort the whole snapshot, then
/// build a fresh AppSearchResult for every row of it. At roughly 2.4us per row that is affordable once
/// and nothing like affordable repeatedly, so painting had to be rationed, and rationing it is what
/// produced a list that climbed to a hundred thousand rows and then sat there while the rest of the
/// search finished.
///
/// Incremental removes the reason to ration. Every result is mapped exactly once no matter how many
/// paints it appears in, so the total cost of a fully progressive search is the cost of the single
/// pass it used to do at the end -- what changes is when that work happens, not how much of it there
/// is. Sorting gets cheaper too (k sorts of n/k beats one sort of n), and the merges that replace it
/// are linear passes over references, cheap enough next to construction to disappear into the noise.
///
/// One accumulator serves one query. The caller hands it the SAME growing list every time, always a
/// prefix-stable arrival-ordered snapshot, and it tracks how far into that list it has already read.
/// </remarks>
