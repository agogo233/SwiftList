// SearchExecutionEngine result filter. Deliberately NOT wired into Settings' own Network Drive page,
// which already does its own per-row liveness check on a 5s timer (NetworkDriveRefreshCoordinator/
// NetworkDriveRowSyncHelper) -- that stays as-is.

// Exists because neither existing "is this source reachable" signal is a good fit for search: local
// drives' own signal only gets refreshed when something is actively polling GetStatusAsync (a search
// window or Settings being open), and network/WSL/folder-index sources only get rechecked on whatever
// refresh interval that source is configured with (15min/hourly/daily, or never at all if set to
// Manual). A fresh, session-scoped check sidesteps both: cheap (one check per session, not per query),
// and never more than one session stale.
