// The two things the panel does TO the settings rather than with them: closing a tab and dragging one.
// Split out purely to keep QuickPanelViewModel.cs under the repo's per-file line limit; it has no state
// of its own and only ever operates on the one view model it is part of.
//
// Everything else the panel offers is per-session -- a group's sort, its view, whether it is collapsed --
// and is deliberately not written anywhere. These two are, because they change what the strip IS rather
// than how one open of it looks: a closed tab that came back on the next summon, or an order that
// forgot itself, would not read as a preference at all.
//
// The caveat that comes with writing from here: the Quick Panel settings page edits a staged copy and
// puts it back on Save, so a page left open across one of these ends up overwriting it. Same rule as
// anywhere else two surfaces write one setting -- whoever saves last wins.
