/// <remarks>
/// Keyed by the source it was built from rather than by the folder it happens to point at: order,
/// visibility and per-group preferences are all stored against a source id, and plugin-provided sources
/// will share that id space without having a path to be keyed by at all.
///
/// The panel used to group through a CollectionView, which was simpler but cannot do this: sorting on
/// a view is a property of the whole view, so every group necessarily shared one order. Ordering per
/// group means the groups have to be real objects that each hold their own items, which is what this
/// is.
///
/// The trade that comes with it: each group renders its own list, so a selection belongs to one group
/// rather than spanning them. Acting on a set of files from two different folders at once is no longer
/// possible, and rubber-banding across a group boundary does nothing.
