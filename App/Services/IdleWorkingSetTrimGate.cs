/// Decides when it is actually worth emptying the process's working set after the quick window hides.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Trimming used to happen 100ms after every hide. It does not free a single byte of committed memory --
/// SetProcessWorkingSetSize(-1,-1) only evicts pages from the working set, and every one of them has to
/// come back the next time the window is summoned. Measured over 21 summons: each one faulted a median
/// of 4,366 pages (about 17MB) back in, and the Show phase where that lands was 70% of the total summon
/// time. That is the price paid for a smaller number in Task Manager, on the interactive path, every
/// single time.
///
/// When the machine is under memory pressure the evicted pages go to the pagefile instead of the standby
/// list, and coming back means real disk reads. An index rebuild supplies exactly that pressure while
/// also saturating the disk with a raw $MFT scan, and the one summon captured in that state took 4.7
/// seconds and never painted at all, faulting 112,876 pages -- twenty-six times a healthy summon.
///
/// So the trim is kept, because giving memory back when the window is genuinely done with is worth
/// something, but it waits for the process to actually be idle. A burst of show/hide (the log shows them
/// 300ms apart) now pays nothing at all. Same shape as the service's own IdleTrimGate, and separated
/// from the timer and the P/Invoke for the same reason: so the decision can be tested directly.
