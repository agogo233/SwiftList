/// <remarks>
/// Every shell entry point this app uses can block without a deadline. Directory.Exists and File.Exists
/// wait out the SMB timeout on a mapped drive whose server is gone; SHParseDisplayName contacts the
/// server behind a UNC path; SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems routes through Explorer, which does not return
/// while Explorer is busy; and ShellExecuteEx (what Process.Start with UseShellExecute does) hands off to
/// whatever shell extension is registered for the target. Called inline from a key press or a menu click,
/// any of those takes the window down with no way back but Task Manager.
///
/// STA specifically, rather than the thread pool: ShellExecuteEx delegates to shell extensions that use
/// COM, and some of them require a single-threaded apartment. The pool is MTA, so work scheduled there is
/// running against that documented requirement even when it happens to work.
