/// <remarks>
/// A fixed tile width left the panel's tiles the same size whatever it was docked to, so a wide window
/// got a row of ten small thumbnails with nothing gained from the space. The width is divided among at
/// most five instead, and every tile spends what it gets on the picture.
///
/// Five is a floor on the count, not a promise of it. Both ends give way, and for the same reason -- a
/// tile is only worth the width it can use:
///
///   - Narrow, where a fifth of the list would be smaller than the tiles used to be: the row wraps at
///     four, or three, which is better than five unreadable ones.
///   - Wide, where a fifth would be more than the picture can fill: the row takes a sixth, an eighth,
///     however many that width now holds. The alternative is five tiles each padded with the space it
///     could not use.
///
/// Whatever the count comes out at, the width is divided between them rather than handed out in fixed
/// lumps, so a row is never short of its own right edge. Smaller tiles are the better trade: an empty
/// strip at the end of every row is the one thing that reads as a mistake.
///
/// What the picture can fill is where the ceiling comes from: icons arrive at 256px from a thumbnail
/// provider and 96 from the shell's own path (see ShellImageListInterop), so past a point a bigger tile
/// is only stretching what it already has.
