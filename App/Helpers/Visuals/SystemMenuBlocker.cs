/// Blocks two OS-level WM_SYSCOMMAND triggers: Alt+Space (SC_KEYMENU), which pops up the OS-drawn
/// system menu (Restore/Move/Size/Minimize/Maximize/Close) as a jarring blank box clipped by the
/// window's own borderless/rounded corners instead of a real title bar; and Alt+F4 (SC_CLOSE), which
/// would let the OS close the window out from under the app's own show/hide lifecycle. Every other
/// WM_SYSCOMMAND subcommand is left untouched.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every custom-chrome window uses this, since none of them has a real title bar for the system menu
/// to belong to. They differ only in whether Alt+F4 goes with it: the settings and full search windows
/// pass blockClose: false, because they are ordinary windows the user opens and is done with and
/// closing them is a perfectly good thing to want.
///
/// The quick window is the one that genuinely cannot do without this, being the application's
/// MainWindow with no ShutdownMode set, so letting Alt+F4 through would take the whole tray app down
/// with it. Attaching it to the inline window has never reliably covered that one: unresolved, and
/// left as it is rather than pursued here.
