/// Shared by every list that navigates this way rather than being written out per call site. The four
/// copies this replaces had been carrying the same defect since they were copied from one another: they
/// stopped when the walk came back to the index it started from, which a modular step can never reach
/// when that index is -1. A list holding nothing selectable -- only headers, or only the "no results"
/// row -- then spun on the UI thread forever, pegging a core and freezing the window.
///
/// -1 is not an edge case here, it is the normal state for a moment: WPF resets SelectedIndex whenever
/// the items are replaced, and the results list is replaced on every keystroke while a search streams
/// in. The callback that puts the selection back runs at Render priority, so an arrow key pressed in
/// that gap arrives with nothing selected -- which is why the hang only ever showed up while typing,
/// and never reproducibly.
