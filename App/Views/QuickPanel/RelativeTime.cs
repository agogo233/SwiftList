/// Came over from the startup panel's Recent Files tab, which is where it was written and which no
/// longer exists; the quick panel had been borrowing it from there. Every string is a format from the
/// translations, so the unit names and their order follow the UI language rather than being assembled
/// out of English words here.
///
/// The smaller unit is dropped when it is zero, so a file touched exactly two hours ago reads as
/// "2 hours ago" rather than "2 hours 0 minutes ago".
