// NetworkGlobPattern rejects a text that lacks the longest literal run its pattern requires, without
// running the compiled regex -- see its own comment for why (the exclusion rules are asked about every
// result on a drive and reject almost none of them). Getting the "required" literal wrong would not
// throw or look broken: the pattern would simply stop matching things it should, so a glob the user
// configured would quietly stop excluding them. Everything here is a pattern where a naive reading of
// the literal would be wrong.
