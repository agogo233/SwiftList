// Every theme's scrollbar thumb has to stay legible on every surface a scrollbar can land on.
//
// It exists because a theme cannot be checked by looking at it. A scrollbar sits on the window, on
// cards, and on the ControlBackground of a text box, and in a dark theme that last one can be thirty
// levels lighter than the window. A thumb colour picked against the window -- the obvious thing to do,
// and what the built-in Dark theme did, flattening VS Code's translucent slider over its own
// background -- lands within a few levels of ControlBackground and disappears, but ONLY inside
// multi-line text boxes. Nothing else in the theme looks wrong. Sixteen of the shipped themes were in
// that state at once and none of it was noticed until a user reported that text box scrollbars had
// stopped appearing.
//
// This cannot cover themes from third-party plugins, which reach the app through IThemeProvider and
// are never seen here. For those the contract is documented in ScrollBar.xaml and nothing more.
