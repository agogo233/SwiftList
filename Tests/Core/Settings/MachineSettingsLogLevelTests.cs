// per-user setting the app and the hook both use, so before this it sat at a hardcoded default and
// every LogLevel.Debug line in the indexer was unreachable no matter what the settings page said.
//
// Hand-edited, so what is pinned here is that it is forgiving about how it is written. A "debug" that
// silently fell back would look exactly like the level having no effect, which is the symptom that made
// the setting necessary in the first place.
