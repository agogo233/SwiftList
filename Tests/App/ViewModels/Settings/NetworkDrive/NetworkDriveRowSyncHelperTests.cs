// A row's enabled state is a persisted user decision. Reachability is a transient probe. Letting the
// second overwrite the first silently deleted a user's folder-index configuration:
//
// UpdateRowsInPlace cleared IsEnabled for any row that was momentarily unreachable. That raised
// PropertyChanged, which set HasPendingEdits -- an edit nobody made -- which pins the refresh
// coordinator to UpdateRowsInPlace and locks out RebuildRows, the one path that recomputes the tick
// from saved settings. Then the next Apply of anything filters rows by IsEnabled and replaces the
// settings list wholesale, so the entry was gone. Coming back, the row read as never configured, and
// re-ticking it was a fresh add: a full re-scan from zero.
//
// UpdateRowsInPlace itself needs a live SearchService (it opens pipes), so it is not constructible
// here. The assignment is what regressed and the assignment is what is pinned, in the same
// source-scanning spirit as Tests/Core/RepositoryHygieneTests -- remembering did not work the first
// time either.
