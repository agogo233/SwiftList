// The Stay Open hotkey (#197) keeps the quick window on screen when focus moves away, so a query can be
// assembled from text copied out of other windows -- hiding clears the query, so a half-built search was
// lost on every switch away.
//
// The flag has to be honoured by the focus-loss hides and by nothing else. QuickSearchWindowController
// needs a live window and a keyboard hook, so it is not constructible here; what regressed in the
// equivalent preview-window bugs was a hide path that failed to consult the flag, and that is what these
// pin, in the same source-scanning spirit as Tests/Core/RepositoryHygieneTests.
