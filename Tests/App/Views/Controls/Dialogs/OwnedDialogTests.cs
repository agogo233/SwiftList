// modal dialog destroyed that way never runs the WPF close that pops ShowDialog's nested dispatcher
// frame and re-enables every window it disabled: the app is left frozen with nothing on screen to
// explain it. The only way to pin that is to close an owner underneath a live modal dialog and require
// the call to come back.
//
// [DoNotParallelize] for the same reason as the other window-level tests here: showing a dialog is
// process-wide, not local to the test doing it -- it disables every window on the thread and pumps a
