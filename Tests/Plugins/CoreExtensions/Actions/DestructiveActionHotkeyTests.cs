// The four actions that move or destroy files ship with no hotkey bound. They used to carry Explorer's
// own keys (Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V, Delete, Shift+Delete), which reads as obvious until you remember where they
// sit: under a search box, where Delete means "delete a character" and Ctrl+V means "paste text". Users
// reported firing them by accident, and Shift+Delete is the one mistake in this set that nothing can
// undo. All four are still in the actions menu and still bindable in Settings -- this only stops them
// being inherited by someone who never asked for them.
