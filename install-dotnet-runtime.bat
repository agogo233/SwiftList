:: Which runtime this needs follows the architecture of the app sitting next to this script, read out of
:: its PE header, rather than the machine's own. Those differ in the case that matters: the x64 package
:: on an arm64 machine needs the x64 runtime, because the app in it is x64 and runs emulated. Asking
:: Windows what IT is would fetch arm64 there and leave the app still unable to start. One copy of this
:: script ships in both packages, so it has to work this out at run time rather than being baked in.

:: runtime installs under dotnet\ and the x64 one under dotnet\x64\, so an x64 package there has to look
:: in the subdirectory: checking dotnet\ would find the ARM64 runtime, decide everything was in place,
:: and skip an install the x64 app cannot start without. Getting this wrong in the other direction only
:: costs a redundant download, since the runtime installer exits quickly when it is already present.
