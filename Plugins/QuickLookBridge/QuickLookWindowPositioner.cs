// Windows) knows. The only reason this needs to poll at all is that Invoke over the pipe is fire-and-
// forget: there's no signal for "the window now exists/updated," so DockTo just keeps checking for up to
// ~3s after being asked to reposition. QuickLook's own layout code re-centers the window on its own
// schedule too (e.g. right after it finishes rendering new content) -- expect it to occasionally win that
// race and leave the window slightly out of place until the next navigation re-asserts the dock.
