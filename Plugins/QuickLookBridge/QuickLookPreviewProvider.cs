// just the ones nothing else covers. RendersExternally tells the host (QuickLookManager) to hide its own
// preview panel instead of showing CreatePreview's content -- the real preview is QuickLook's own floating
// window. IReceivesPreviewPanelBounds gets the exact screen rectangle that panel would have occupied, so
// QuickLookWindowPositioner can dock QuickLook's window there via plain SetWindowPos (a re-parenting/
// style-stripping approach was tried first and reverted: QuickLook was never designed to be embedded, and
// fighting its own window-management logic that way produced worse glitches than this simpler move-only
