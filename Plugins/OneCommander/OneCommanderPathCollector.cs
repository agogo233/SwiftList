/// Collects the active folder path from a OneCommander window outside of an inline-search session (e.g.
/// for "jump to this folder" prompts when a save/open dialog appears). Unlike Directory Opus / Total
/// Commander, OneCommander's top-level window class name is generated at runtime by WPF rather than a
/// fixed native class, so CanHandle can't check for an exact literal class name -- WPF's default class name
/// embeds the hosting executable's name (e.g. "HwndWrapper[OneCommander.exe;;&lt;guid&gt;]"), so this matches on
/// that substring instead. Narrow enough that it won't misfire on other WPF apps in practice, but not
/// verified against a live OneCommander install; if a build customizes its window class this simply never
/// matches (harmless -- this collector just never triggers, core inline search is unaffected).
