namespace SwiftList.Plugins.DirectoryOpus.Favorites;

// One entry of Directory Opus's Favorites menu. Covers all three things favorites.ofv can hold: a
// submenu (<folder>, Children set), a favorited location (<path>, Path set), and a divider
// (<separator>). Also covers the real subfolders discovered while browsing a favorited directory, which
// are the same shape -- a label and a path -- so they need no type of their own.
//
// Path must be a property, not a field: App/Services/ShellMenu/QuickNavigationPathResolver.cs resolves a
// submenu handle back to a path via reflection (GetProperty("Path")) to load a real file-type icon --
// GetProperty finds compiled property accessors only, never a plain field, so a field here would silently
// leave every cascaded directory entry iconless. Same reason DirMenuNode states it.
