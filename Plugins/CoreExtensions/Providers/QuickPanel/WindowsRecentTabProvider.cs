/// The shell drops a shortcut into %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent every time a document is opened in
/// any application, whether or not this app was involved. That makes it a different list from the app's
/// own history, and the one people mean by "what was I just working on".
///
/// The shortcuts are resolved to the files they point at, rather than being shown as the .lnk files they
/// are. That costs a COM call per entry, which is why the cap is applied first: only the newest handful
/// are ever resolved. It buys the real name, the real folder and, in a panel that shows thumbnail tiles
/// by default, the file's own thumbnail instead of a shortcut icon for every entry alike.
