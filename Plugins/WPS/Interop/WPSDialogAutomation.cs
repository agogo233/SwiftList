/// rather than giving each a HWND of its own, so a child-window walk finds nothing to address. UI
/// Automation is the only view onto that widget tree, and it is also where the identifying class names
/// ("KcfdFileDialog" and friends) are visible at all -- the Win32 class of the window is a generic
/// "Qt5QWindowIcon".

///     KcfdFileDialog                 the dialog

///           QLineEdit                the editor -- or kd::KDTextField, or any Edit control
