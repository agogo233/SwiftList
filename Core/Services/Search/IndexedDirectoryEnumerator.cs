/// There are two places an index can live, the same split search itself works with (see
/// <c>SearchService.SearchStreamingAsync</c>'s local/network tasks): local drives are indexed by the
/// elevated service and reached over the pipe, while network, WSL and folder indexes live in THIS
/// process. A local drive enabled for indexing is indexed in full, so it is asked first and answers on
/// its own; everything else falls through to the in-process indexes, and only then to the disk. A
/// folder index is what makes that last hop worth taking for a local path the service doesn't cover.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The user's exclusion settings deliberately play no part here: the caller named one exact directory,
/// which is the same "show me what is actually in this place" intent that already bypasses them for a
/// path-mode query. Hidden and system entries ARE dropped though, exactly as they are for every other
/// search result -- that filter is a separate, always-on one, not part of those settings. It applies to
/// an entry's own attributes only: a hidden directory is still walked through, just never returned.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Every call re-decides on its own, and nothing about a fallback is remembered: a directory answered
/// by a live walk today (index still building, service restarting) is answered from the index the
