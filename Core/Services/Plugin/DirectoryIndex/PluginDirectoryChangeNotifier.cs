/// quiet period, from two kinds of source at once: the per-directory FileSystemWatcher this registry
/// already runs, and the indexes themselves reporting that they just took an update in.
/// <para>
/// The index half exists because a watcher event and the index are not in step: a watcher fires the
/// instant the filesystem changes, while the USN journal is read on a poll, so a plugin that re-listed
/// immediately could read an index that has not caught up yet and miss the file that triggered it. An
/// index signal cannot be early by construction -- it IS the index having changed -- and the debounce
/// below settles the two into one refresh. It also covers a stretch where the watcher itself was down
/// (buffer overflow, share disconnected), which today is only noticed on its next reconnect.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The watcher half stays because it is the only signal for a directory no index covers -- a drive
/// indexing is off for, an unconfigured share, a path that does not exist yet. Everywhere else the
/// index sees every kind of change, edits to a file's contents included: those refresh its size and
/// timestamps (see UsnIndexerExtensions' metadata pass) and bump the drive's revision like any other.
