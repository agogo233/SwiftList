// NameSearch to top up a page the names alone did not fill. That trigger is what keeps this cheap: a
// query that already answers in full never reaches it. Everything found here is appended after the
// name hits rather than merged with them, so the ranking can reuse the matched term's own sort key
// untouched -- no sort-key surgery, and no risk of pushing a genuine name match down.

// Distinct from PathSearch, which models a POSITIONAL "dir\subdir\file" query: there the query's
// segments must appear in ancestors in that same order. Here the terms carry no position at all, so
// each ancestor is offered every still-unsatisfied term (fzf terms are already order-free against a
// name; this extends the same property across the path).
//
// Deliberate v1 restriction: at least one term must match the FILE NAME. Without it the candidate set
// becomes "every row under any folder matching any term", which one common folder name turns
// into most of a drive -- and that set cannot be enumerated from phase A's per-term unique hits, which
// is exactly what keeps the row walk here bounded to the same order of work as an ordinary search.
