// Single choke point for starting a drive's live monitor (USN journal or folder watcher), used by cold
// start (SearchEngineInitializer), a manual per-drive rebuild (SearchEngineDriveMaintenance), and hot-plug
// recovery (DriveRecovery) alike -- previously each of those three call sites independently constructed
// its own UsnMonitor/FolderDriveMonitor with no per-drive bookkeeping anywhere, so restarting a drive's
// monitor (e.g. clicking "重建" on an already-running drive) left the OLD one running forever alongside
// the new one: both kept reapplying the same USN/folder changes, and each was a separate, untracked
// source racing UsnIndexer.UpdateDriveCounts against whichever monitor's drive was actually mid-rebuild.
// Routing every call through here means UsnIndexer.RegisterDriveMonitor always stops the previous monitor
// for that drive first, so there is only ever one live per drive.
