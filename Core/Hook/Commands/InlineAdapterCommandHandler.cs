// Split out of HookCommandHandler to keep that file under the line-count limit. Runs
// IInlineSearchAdapter's write-side methods (ExecuteItem/OnSelectionChanged/OnSearchFinished) here in the
// Hook process instead of the App process, so navigating a third-party file manager (Total Commander,
// Directory Opus, ...) still works when that file manager is running elevated and the App -- which never
// elevates itself -- would otherwise have its window messages silently dropped by UIPI. Mirrors the
// resolve-then-dispatch shape HookCommandHandler already uses for NavigateDialog/RestoreDialogFocus.
//
// Each call runs on its own freshly-spun-up STA thread (RunOnSta), not ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem and
// NOT the tracker thread that owns ExplorerTracker: some adapters (Explorer's IShellWindows/Navigate2/
// SelectItem, OneCommander's UI Automation) are STA-affine COM interop, so an MTA ThreadPool thread would
// force COM to marshal across apartments. A dedicated thread per call, rather than routing through the
// tracker thread, matters because at least one adapter (Total Commander) calls plain SendMessage with no
// timeout (see TotalCommander/Win32/Win32Helper.cs) -- if that target hangs, only this one call's thread
// leaks/blocks; ExplorerTracker's own WinEvent-based foreground/focus tracking (which runs on the tracker
// thread) keeps working for every other window and adapter regardless.

    // Each InlineSelectionChanged gets its own throwaway thread (see RunOnSta below), so rapid
    // selection changes can have several calls in flight at once with no ordering guarantee between
    // them -- a slower, older call finishing after a faster, newer one would silently revert Explorer's
    // highlighted item back to a stale selection. InlineSelectionChanged fires on far more than just
    // arrow-key navigation -- the App re-selects each new result set's first item on every keystroke
    // while typing, so this message arrives roughly once per character during normal use, not just
    // during deliberate navigation.
    //
    // This counter gives each call a sequence number assigned in arrival order (IPC messages are
    // handled one at a time, so the assignment itself is race-free). Each dispatched call first waits
    // SelectionDebounceMs before doing anything, then bails out if a newer call has been assigned in
    // the meantime -- so a burst of rapid changes (continuous typing, or holding an arrow key) produces
    // at most one real sync, for wherever the user actually settles, instead of racing a COM call per
    // intermediate keystroke (which starved out almost every call during active typing -- an earlier,
    // debounce-less version of this fix that only checked staleness immediately at thread-start made
    // auto-select feel completely broken while typing, since a newer keystroke's message almost always
    // arrived before the current thread even got scheduled).
