    /// read those: it runs as LocalSystem, and UserSettings lives under the interactive user's
    /// %LocalAppData%. That is why the service had no configurable level at all -- App and the hook both
    /// set Logger.MinimumLevel from the user setting on startup, and the --service branch never had
    /// anything to read, so every LogLevel.Debug line in the indexer was unreachable no matter what the
    /// settings page said. The USN layer's own diagnostics live at that level.
    ///
    /// No settings page: this is a diagnostic dial, edited by hand in machine-settings.json when
    /// somebody is actually looking, and left alone otherwise. Info by default, matching what the app
    /// and the hook run at -- the service's log is the one place a problem in the indexer shows up, and
