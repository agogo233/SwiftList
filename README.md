SwiftList is an ultra-lightweight, high-performance, extensible global search and productivity launcher for Windows, built on **.NET 10 (WPF)**. It's a modern, open-source alternative to **Everything** and **Listary** — indexing local drives via the NTFS **USN Journal** and MFT for near-instant, low-resource search.

📖 **[Full documentation, User Manual & Developer Manual](https://swiftlist.github.io/)**

## Highlights

- **Millisecond indexing** — reads the NTFS USN Journal/MFT directly instead of walking directories; a low-footprint background service keeps the index in sync in real time.
- **FZF-style fuzzy search** — multi-keyword fuzzy matching with prefix/suffix/exact/exclude operators, plus pinyin aliasing for Chinese filenames.
- **Three ways to search** — a quick popup window, a full main window, and an inline bar that docks directly into File Explorer or native file dialogs.
- **QuickLook preview**, a right-click-style actions menu, and hotkeys that are all rebindable.
- **Open plugin SDK** — extend search providers, aliases, context-menu actions, result columns, previews, and themes.
- **Process isolation** — a SYSTEM-level indexing service kept separate from the per-user app UI.

See the **[User Manual](https://swiftlist.github.io/user-guide/)** for search syntax, every hotkey, and every settings option; the **[Developer Manual](https://swiftlist.github.io/dev-guide/)** for architecture and the plugin SDK reference.
