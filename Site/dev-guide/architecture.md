# Architecture

![SwiftList architecture](/architecture.svg)

## Process split

SwiftList runs as three separate processes, deliberately isolated by privilege level and lifetime:

- **`SwiftList.Service`** — a Windows service running as `LocalSystem`. It owns all file indexing:
  reading the USN Journal and MFT for NTFS/ReFS drives, walking and watching other local file
  systems directly (they have no journal to read), scanning and caching network shares, and
  answering search queries over a named pipe. Running this at SYSTEM level means it can read the
  raw volume metadata every user account is allowed to see, without granting the interactive App
  process elevated privileges it doesn't need.
- **`SwiftList.App`** — the per-user, session-level WPF application: the search windows, the
  Settings window, hotkey handling, and the Actions/QuickLook UI. It talks to the Service over a
  named pipe (`SearchService`/`UsnServicePipeServer` in `Core.Services`) and never touches the disk
  index directly. It also hosts a second, per-user pipe of its own (`AppSearchPipeService`) that
  lets the `slf` CLI companion (see [Command-Line Search](../user-guide/cli)) reuse the App's
  already-initialized search state — loaded alias/plugin providers, configured network-drive
  indexes — instead of a bare client process having to replicate that setup itself.
- **`SwiftList.Service --hook`** — a small separate process hosting the low-level global keyboard
  hook, so a hook crash or a misbehaving foreground app can't take the main App process down with
  it. It also loads plugins' window-integration adapters and runs their calls itself — see
  [Where plugins fit](#where-plugins-fit) below.

## Shared Core

`Core` is a class library referenced by both the Service and the App. It holds:

- The search engine (`Core/SearchIndex/Fzf/*`) — a fuzzy-matching implementation modeled on the
  `fzf` command-line tool's algorithm, plus a query parser (`SearchQueryParser`) for drive-letter
  targeting and path-mode search.
- The runtime index (`Core/IndexV2/*`) — a memory-mapped, columnar snapshot format built from
  USN/MFT reads, with an in-memory delta overlay for changes since the last snapshot.
- IPC contracts (`SearchRequestMessage`, `SearchResponseBinarySerializer`, ...) shared verbatim by
  both processes, so the App and Service always agree on the wire format.
- `Logger` — writes to per-process log files (`service.log`, `app.log`, `hook.log`), all readable
  (but not all writable) from the App's Settings → Service Status log viewer.

## Where plugins fit

Plugins are `.dll` assemblies referencing `PluginSdk` and are loaded by the App process (see
[Getting Started](./getting-started) and [Packaging & Deployment](./packaging)). Two plugins ship
with SwiftList itself as first-class examples — `SwiftList.Plugins.CoreExtensions` (built-in file
actions and the shell context-menu integration) and `SwiftList.Plugins.PinyinAlias` (pinyin
aliasing for Chinese filenames) — see [Example Plugins](./examples) for a walkthrough of both.

Plugins never talk to the Service directly; they interact with the App through the interfaces
documented in the Plugin SDK Reference, and with the disk index (when they need custom indexed
directories) through `DirectoryIndexerService`, which proxies to the Service on their behalf.

Window-integration adapters are the one exception to being App-only:
[`IActivePathCollector`, `IFileDialogAdapter`, and `IInlineSearchAdapter`](./sdk/system-adapters)
implementations are loaded a second time into the Hook process, and their calls run there instead
of in the App. This is what lets SwiftList drive an elevated File Explorer/file dialog/third-party
file manager window even though the App itself always runs unelevated — Windows blocks a
lower-privilege process from sending input to a higher-privilege one, so the call has to originate
from a process running at the same privilege level as the target.
