# Favorites

Pin frequently-used folders, files, or URLs so they're always one keystroke away.

## Adding a favorite

- **Display Name** — optional; if left blank and the target is a local path, it's auto-filled from
  the path's filename.
- **Target Path** — a local path, or an `http://`/`https://` URL.
- **Browse Folder** / **Browse File** buttons open a native picker instead of typing the path.
- **Add** button — enabled once a path is entered.

## Managing the list

Each favorite in the list shows its name and target path, with per-row actions:

- **Move Up** / **Move Down** — reorders the list, which also affects how favorites rank against
  other search results. Each row can also be dragged directly by the six-dot handle on its left
  edge — the same drag-to-reorder handle used by every other reorderable list in Settings (Result
  Type Priority, Quick Navigation Order, Sidebar Filter Order, and Results Grid Column Order).
- **Edit** — loads the item back into the fields above for changes.
- **Remove** — deletes it.

## How favorites show up in search

A matching favorite appears in results with a **★** marker next to its folder/path label, and is
searchable by its display name — including pinyin, if the name contains Chinese characters, the
same as any other result. This is SwiftList's closest equivalent to a custom search alias; see
[Search Syntax](../search-syntax#favorites-not-custom-aliases).
