# Supported File Managers

SwiftList doesn't only search — it can also integrate with the file manager or dialog you're
currently using. Depending on the target, that integration can mean up to three things:

- **Inline search docking** — a SwiftList search bar embeds directly into the target window (the
  [inline window](./getting-started#the-three-windows)), so you can search without leaving it.
- **Quick Navigation** — the target responds to the [quick navigation mouse
  triggers](./hotkeys#quick-navigation-mouse) (double-click/middle-click, or the inline window's
  own logo), popping a cascading menu of Favorites, History, and quick-access folders.
- **Active path detection** — SwiftList can tell which folder is currently open in the target, so
  it can scope a search to that folder and resolve path-relative actions (like Copy Path) against
  it.

Not every integration provides all three — see the table below.

## Built in (no extra install)

These come bundled with SwiftList's core extensions plugin — nothing to enable separately.

| Target | Inline search docking | Quick Navigation | Active path detection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows File Explorer | Yes | Double-click or middle-click | Yes |
| Modern Open/Save file dialog | Yes (this *is* the inline window) | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |
| Classic Open/Save file dialog | Yes | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |
| Classic Browse-for-Folder dialog | Yes | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |

Active path detection doesn't apply to the dialogs themselves — there's no "other window" for
SwiftList to scope a search against once it's already docked inside the dialog.

## Optional plugins (Settings → Plugins)

Each of these ships as its own plugin. Install/enable it from [Settings →
Plugins](./settings/plugins), then use that plugin's own **Configure** dialog to toggle **Enable
Inline Search** and **Enable Quick Navigation** independently — both default to on.

| Target | Inline search docking | Quick Navigation | Active path detection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Directory Opus | Yes | Middle-click on a file list pane | Yes |
| Files | Yes | Middle-click on a file list pane | Yes |
| One Commander | Yes | Middle-click on a file list pane | Yes |
| Total Commander | Yes | Middle-click on a file list pane | Yes |
| XYplorer | Yes | Middle-click on a file list pane | Yes |

All five detect their target by matching the running process (and, for Directory Opus and Total
Commander, by talking to their documented remote-control interface over `WM_COPYDATA` rather than
scraping the UI); Files and One Commander instead use UI Automation, since neither exposes a
remote-control protocol.

## Application dialogs (optional plugins)

These target one specific dialog inside a third-party application — not the whole application —
the same way the built-in dialogs above do. Install/enable from [Settings →
Plugins](./settings/plugins); each ships a single component with its own on/off switch there (no
separate Configure dialog, since there's only one thing to toggle).

| Target | Inline search docking | Quick Navigation | Active path detection |
|---|---|---|---|
| WPS Office's Open/Save dialog | Yes | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |
| WinRAR's Extract dialog | Yes | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |
| Bandizip's Extract dialog | Yes | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |
| Bandizip's Add Files dialog | Yes | Middle-click, or left-click the inline window's own logo | — |

Detected by control structure, not window title, so this works across every language pack each
application ships. The WPS entry covers Writer, Spreadsheets, Presentation and the PDF reader, which
all share the one dialog — WPS uses its own rather than the Windows one, which is why it needs a
plugin at all where most applications are covered by the built-in dialogs above. As with those,
active path detection doesn't apply — SwiftList is already docked inside the dialog itself, with no
other window to scope a search against.
